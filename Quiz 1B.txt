A server has a fixed address in the network.
In practice, a server can consist of many computers that are reached at a common address.
Clients do not communicate directly with each other.

P2P networks rely on the principle that users make their resources available for sharing (resources for storage, communication, processing, etc).
A P2P network has no predefined structure. Instead, it is formed dynamically by the nodes ("peers") that for the moment are participating in the network (sharing a file, for instance).

HTTP is a text-based protocol (not binary), which means that HTTP requests and responses are transmitted in text format.
By using web caches it is possible to reduce the response time for client requests.
Each web object (page, image, movie, etc.) has a unique identifier that can be used to address the object.
